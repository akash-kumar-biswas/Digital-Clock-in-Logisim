# Digital Clock in Logisim

A fully functional digital clock designed and simulated using **Logisim**, a digital circuit design and simulation tool. This project demonstrates the implementation of counters, flip-flops, and logic gates to build a real-time clock circuit.

---

## Features

- Displays hours, minutes, and seconds in digital format.
- Uses synchronous counters to keep track of time.
- Implements flip-flops and logic gates for control and timing signals.
- Simulates clock behavior accurately within Logisim.

## Technologies Used

- **Logisim** - Digital logic circuit simulator

---

## Project Overview

This digital clock circuit was created as a learning project to understand the basics of digital electronics, including:

- Binary counters
- Flip-flops (JK, D, or T flip-flops)
- Logic gate implementation (AND, OR, NOT, XOR)
- Timing and synchronization techniques
